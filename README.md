## Description

This project is a part of the AirBnB clone series, focusing on building a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. The command interpreter allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects, serving as the foundation for the subsequent development of a full web application.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a Python script named `console.py` that provides an interactive shell for managing AirBnB objects. It supports various commands to perform operations on objects, such as creating new instances, retrieving objects from storage, updating attributes, and destroying objects.
